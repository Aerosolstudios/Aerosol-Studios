            <h1>The pitfalls of opportunity</h1>
           
            <h3>Constraints force creativity</h3>
            <p>When humans are confronted with seemingly insurmountable challenges, we often respond with remarkable ingenuity and creativity. The more constraints we face, the more creative we become. Some of the most brilliant solutions have emerged from scenarios where severe limitations have forced innovative thinking. For entrepreneurs, the challenge is to offer something that consumers need or want in a new or different way.</p>
            <p>This can manifest in various forms—a new channel, service, product, or brand. Many founders gravitate towards product innovation because it's tangible.</p>
            <p>It’s important to note that in consumer products, innovation is typically incremental. This differs from the tech industry, where dramatic and market-changing innovations are the benchmark. In consumer products, innovation can be as subtle as new packaging or a new route to market. I recently spoke to a seasoned investor who argued that there is no such thing as true product innovation in consumer goods for this very reason, and I tend to agree with him.</p>
            <p>The key is addressing customer needs. Often, "need" is interchangeable with "want." Regardless of whether it’s a need or a want, the emotional connection driving the purchase is crucial.</p>
            <p>Each of these areas—product, channel, service, and brand—offers opportunities. However, in my opinion, it all comes back to the audience connection (brand). It’s rare, if not unheard of, for more than one innovation to succeed at a time. The fastest-growing companies innovate in just one of these areas, focus on it, and execute it well. The most successful brands don’t try to do everything; they are built around one thing they do better than the rest, and they drive that home.</p>
            <p>In the early 2010s, Gymshark innovated by leveraging the power of influencer marketing when it was still a novel concept. The company strategically gifted its uniquely designed fitness apparel to popular influencers in the bodybuilding community, who had amassed large followings on platforms like Instagram and YouTube. By aligning their brand with influential figures who embodied their target audience's aspirations, Gymshark generated authentic endorsements and organic content, driving significant brand visibility and credibility. This grassroots approach allowed Gymshark to rapidly build a loyal customer base and establish itself as a prominent name in the fitness apparel industry. Today, it is one of a handful of unicorns in the consumer products sector.</p>
            
            <h3>How Does This Relate to Less Capital Making Better Businesses?</h3>
            <p>These opportunities to innovate are well-disguised pitfalls. For example, adding an Amazon shop to your physical store will reduce the hours available to keep the shop open. If you then add after-sale service, it would further reduce those hours. Introducing a new product line would require development time, further diminishing the time available to focus on the core business. While this is a simplified example, it highlights the pitfalls of opportunity. Time is your most precious commodity; be wary of opportunities that spread your time too thin.</p>
            <p>If you’re starting out with plenty of capital, all these options seem attractive. Many founders innovate in multiple areas to capture as many opportunities as possible. It feels like a reduction of risk, but in reality, you’re diluting your focus. This means nothing is explored in depth, leading to a situation where it’s unclear which innovations are working and which are not. This can result in a waste of both time and money. This is why less capital often makes for better businesses: it forces you to focus on a single innovation or hypothesis and test it to its full potential. Often, it requires numerous taxing iterations to make it succeed. With a large amount of cash, it’s unlikely that an idea will be pushed until it truly works.</p>
            
            <h3>A low capital base</h3>
            <p>Operating with a low capital base presents an opportunity to create value. Having limited resources—particularly time and expertise—combined with a lack of consumer awareness and an underdeveloped brand strategy, can drive innovation.</p>
            <p>Early-stage consumer product companies are often cash-generative. The cash-generative nature of these businesses allows them to start and grow more easily in the early stages than a technology start-up, which typically requires a significant amount of product development before sales can begin. Consumer product founders can start companies on a minimal budget and make their first sale, bringing cash into the business. This ease of entry creates low barriers, making consumer awareness even more important and harder to achieve.</p>
            <p>The way in which these challenges are overcome defines a company. It means learning lessons the hard way, making mistakes, and experiencing slower growth than the idea’s potential. Slower growth isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it can unsettle and frustrate founders.</p>
            <p>I haven’t mentioned product-market fit here because, in consumer products, the lack of true innovation means it’s almost impossible not to have product-market fit. What I mean is that product innovation in consumer goods is almost entirely incremental and often quickly followed by competitors, which limits its value. That’s not to say the product doesn’t matter—your lifetime value will be lower with a poor product versus a quality one, and your brand will be affected either way. </p>
            <p>However, product innovation alone won’t sell your product. The biggest failure is failing to achieve brand-market fit. This leads to one of my key investing principles: brand is everything; product is secondary. Building consumer awareness and a tested brand strategy with limited resources is the essence of achieving brand-market fit.</p>
            <p>Having limited capital drives founders to start with a minimum viable brand and iterate. This is a sound business practice; one of the great resources on this methodology is Eric Ries’ The Lean Startup. Creative and scrappy marketing is one of the most critical factors for success in early-stage consumer product businesses. Finding the cheapest method to generate connection and sales is the key to growth in these businesses and the creation of value—a fact often overlooked when more capital is available. It’s this value that I look for as an early investor.</p>
        
            <h3>Too much, too soon</h3>
            <p>Particularly in recent times, buoyed by crowdfunding, many consumer brands seize the opportunity to raise money after achieving ‘proof of concept.’</p>
            <p>With the increase in available capital, the bar for proof of concept has dropped lower and lower. Over the last decade, it’s never been easier to raise money as an early-stage consumer product company. This has led to some eye-watering valuations, with questionable implications for the power curves that sit behind them—a topic for another time. Crowdfunding is a noble, democratic idea that struggles in practice.</p>
            <p><i>Sidebar: Sixty-six percent of LP respondents said they believe their VC portfolios are overvalued, and 36% said the same about their PE investments. The scepticism is, in part, a hangover from 2021’s sky-high private market valuations and the low-interest-rate environment in the US, but it also highlights a fundamental difference in the way PE and VC managers value their investments.</i></p>

            <p>This influx of capital shifts brands from a cashflow-driven capital allocation process to having millions of pounds burning a hole in their pocket, what seems to be an endless opportunity set, and lofty expectations from investors. High valuations come with high expectations, leaving limited room for failure or learning. Failing to meet expectations is usually terminal for small early-stage companies. They lack the momentum, due to a lack of critical mass, to weather a large down round. This is the case for at least the first five years of their existence.</p>
            <p>This situation is ripe for poor decision-making. The pressure, combined with a large bank balance, often leads once-creative and scrappy businesses to indulge in expensive branding exercises and an over-reliance on inorganic marketing.</p>
            <p>Performance marketing is the critical evaluation of your marketing expenditure. This often goes out the window after the first large raise when it’s someone else’s money. Too many early-stage consumer companies rush to deploy capital to achieve growth, deprioritising the evaluation of returns. This is driven by the high growth expectations from high valuations and a belief that their resource-constrained days are behind them.</p>
            <p>The short-term sales growth from paid media is addictive, but it often comes at the expense of building long-term brand equity. If the focus is solely on sales growth, then management will keep pressing the paid media accelerator pedal. This approach often leads to unimaginative content creation. Content creation cannot be outsourced—how can you outsource your connection with your audience? That isn’t to say that expertise shouldn’t be brought in, but the strategy and heart must come from the core of the business—the founders.</p>
