            <h1>Less capital makes a better business</h1>
            <h2>Consumer isn't tech</h2> 

            <p>Consumer product companies, in the early stages, are currently following a traditional VC funding schedule. The funding schedule typically mimics the proven tech VC funding schedule; in some aspects.
                
                Consumer product start-ups are typically bootstrapped in the early stages. The cash generative nature of these businesses enables them to start and grow much more easily than a technology start-up in the early stages.
                
                Consumer product founders are able to start companies on minimal budget and time before getting to the first sale. This provides cash flow and confidence to continue to invest. A low capital founding has both positive and negative effects.
                
                **Impacts of a lack of capital in the first 3 years**
                
                A lack of capital in the first 3 years gives rise to a number of risks / difficulties:
                
                - a lack of resources, the most significant being time & expertise
                - a lack of consumer awareness
                - underdeveloped brand strategy
                - time pressure
                
                These risks and difficulties can be overcome with hard work and effort. They often lead to lessons being learnt the hard way, making mistakes rather than learning from others, and slower growth than the idea or companies potential. Slower growth isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it can make the early years harder. Time pressure can lead to a number of poor decisions. Those around the founder can often question poorly in the early stages the vision and concept of the business. With little in sales or data to counter these questions can lead to pressure and poor decision making.
                
                I haven’t mentioned product market fit here. That's because without product market fit companies don’t and won’t get to year three therefore I am taking it as a given at this stage. It however is an important consideration for us when founding companies.
                
                On the other side there are a number of benefits of a lack of capital in the early years:
                
                - Product market fit is found with minimal capital
                - Creative and scrappy marketing
                
                With no capital it drives founders to start with a minimum viable product and iterate. This is a sound founding practice; see Eric Ries The Lean Startup for more on minimum viable products. Creative and scrappy marketing is one of the most important drivers of success in early stage consumer product businesses; after product market fit. Finding the cheapest method of generating sales is the key driver of growth in early stage consumer product businesses. As we discuss late, is often overlooked when more capital is available.
                
                **Early funding**
                
                At £1m of sales young companies, recently, have often taken the opportunity to raise money. This has no doubt been fuelled by the availability of capital for the last decade plus.
                
                **Example of bootstrapped companies that have raised at £1m inc references: Puresport, Dollar Shave Club, Wild Nutrition…**
                
                A sudden surfeit of capital reduces a number of risks. Expertise and additional resources become available. Consumer awareness can be increased through increased marketing spend. The brand strategy is often improved at this point with time and expertise, as opposed to it being authentically organic in the first three years. It also often reduces the time pressure on founders, a full time, appropriate salary is available and is a major proof point to those observing from the outside.
                
                Raising at £1m revenue however does come with a set of risks & traps.
                
                The injection of capital comes with targets and expectations of accelerated growth. High valuations are understandably desirable for founders, but these high valuations come with high expectations. Significant growth targets, particularly in the short term, from investors often lead to poor decision making.
                
                **Figure showing the Valuation ranges that I have seen**
                
                This investor pressure and a large bank balance, for the first time, has resulted in a number of these creative scrappy businesses to expensive brand or marketing exercises and an over reliance on inorganic marketing.
                
                Performance marketing has its place, but combined with high growth expectations, it can become a crutch. The short term sales growth and cash flow are an addictive combination. This comes at the price of brand capital.
                
                # Marketing is the be all & end all
                
                Brand capital is built and earnt through the relationship that the brand has with its consumers. In the first three years, with limited capital, the relationship is close between the founder (visionary) and consumer. In successful consumer product startups this is due to authentic storytelling. The founder saw a need or problem in the market, created a brand and product to overcome that problem and meet that need.
                
                This can appear overly mechanistic, however, the most common successful consumer product company is not one that invents a product to solve a problem, rather one that creates a brand that services an emotional need. The servicing of this emotional need can be a powerful connection between brand and consumer. This is, in my opinion, is how you create brand equity in the modern world.
                
                A good example of this is fashionable wellness, brands that have started to service the need for ‘cool’ brands creating products that improve your health. Not so much a product need that was missing, there have been wellness brands around for decades, rather a brand need that was missing.
                
                Performance marketing can lead brands to lose sight of the brand equity that they have built with their consumers. Paid advertising on social media is effective at driving sales. There is no doubt this is true. However, the early 2010’s showed the markets the limits of this. Performance marketing isn’t an ATM through which you can push ever increasing spend into and have consistent returns.
                
                **CPA graph showing the increasing cost of acquisition as the total advertising spend increases.**
                
                The balance to this is brand equity.
                
                The closest measurable indicator is organic growth. Organic growth is harder and takes significantly longer, but it requires an engaged audience. An audience that believes and engages with your brand consistently and likes your product. This has two outcomes: your engaged audience grows and consistently buys your product. Your sales are exponentially correlated to marketing spend.
                
                Without an engaged audience you are likely to only make one sale at the point that you show them the advert. The long term value (LTV), in terms of the volume of sales, is 1. Your sales are linearly correlated to marketing spend. Over the long term the cost of acquisition will creeps up as you penetrate your market pushing the correlation down. Less and less sales per unit of marketing spend. This can lead to a spiral of increasing inorganic marketing spend which in turn pushes the acquisition cost higher and further reducing returns. All with the aim of meeting high expectations and growth targets.
                
                This famine to feast of capital can lead to poor behaviours and the management team to lose sight of the drivers of early success. At £1m of sales these businesses are usually in the position to be EBIT or cash neutral.
                
                We see this as an investment size and timing issue. An appropriate amount of capital at the outset reduces some of the risks and maintains the scrappy creative drive to build brand equity.
                
                **Revenue curve comparison tech start-ups year 0-5 vs consumer products. The growth curve is significantly more linear for consumer product companies than tech companies, meaning that the investment power curve from tech doesn’t hold in consumer products.**</p>
