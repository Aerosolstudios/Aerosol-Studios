        <h2>Constraints force creativity</h2>
        <p>When faced with a seemingly impassable brick wall humanity is at its most resourceful in creating ways around or over. This constraint scenario is where some of the most ingenious solutions have been created. When starting a brand your challenge is to offer something to consumers that they need that isn’t currently being met.</p>
        <p>That can be a variety of different things - channel, service, product or brand. Most founders focus on product as it is the most tangible, but isn’t the whole challenge.</p>
        <p>If it's raining you need an umbrella, the need is an umbrella, and nothing more. When it's raining you don’t particularly mind whether the umbrella has a beautiful wood handle or is plastic. You just want to be dry and both achieve the same solution so this innovation misses the mark.</p>
        <p>You need to be selling an umbrella when customers need it. Why are there so many umbrella stands outside underground station exits? It's when those of us who haven’t checked the weather forecast need an umbrella. It's all very well selling umbrellas on Amazon, but next day delivery isn’t a lot of help when you are being rained on. You have to be selling in the right channel and constrain yourself to only that channel.</p>
        <p>When we buy that umbrella from the stand just outside the underground station it's a straightforward transaction. There is no point in keeping your receipt as you aren’t getting a refund when it breaks in a couple of weeks. There’s no service, you aren’t being sold a variety or after purchase care. It's relatively cheap and elevates a painful need of being rained on so we don’t mind. There is no point in calling your customers up after a couple of weeks to see how they are getting on. You need to understand the service level your customers need and constrain yourself to that.</p>
        <p>Finally, there is brand. Whilst that spontaneous purchase on the street meets our immediate need of not being rained on, it doesn’t produce an emotional connection. It doesn’t tell people something about who we are. If that umbrella was purchased in a fine Mayfair shop which has a fantastic insta and a beautiful brand logo on the fabric it communicates who we are. The brand gives us an emotion and the product communicates this every time we use it.</p>
        <p>All of these are opportunities for innovation. In consumer products rarely does more than one innovation work. The fastest growing companies innovate on one of these, they focus, and execute. You don’t find the fastest growing brands making cheap and expensive products, they aren’t on / in every media, they aren’t adding service where it isn’t needed or excessive branding / marketing when it isn’t needed.</p>

        <h2>Consumer products are not tech</h2>
        <p>Consumer product companies, in the early stages, are currently following a traditional VC funding schedule. The funding schedule typically mimics the proven tech VC funding schedule; in some aspects.</p>
        <p>Consumer product start-ups are typically bootstrapped in the early stages. The cash generative nature of these businesses enables them to start and grow much more easily than a technology start-up in the early stages.</p>
        <p>Consumer product founders are able to start companies on minimal budget and time before getting to the first sale. This provides cash flow and confidence to continue to invest. A low capital founding has both positive and negative effects.</p>

    <section id="marketing">
        <h2>Marketing is the be all & end all</h2>
        <p>Brand capital is built and earned through the relationship that the brand has with its consumers. In the first three years, with limited capital, the relationship is close between the founder (visionary) and consumer. In successful consumer product startups this is due to authentic storytelling. The founder saw a need or problem in the market, created a brand and product to overcome that problem and meet that need.</p>
        <p>This can appear overly mechanistic, however, the most common successful consumer product company is not one that invents a product to solve a problem, rather one that creates a brand that services an emotional need. The servicing of this emotional need can be a powerful connection between brand and consumer. This is, in my opinion, is how you create brand equity in the modern world.</p>
